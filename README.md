When you open the app you are welcomed with a colorful homescreen. You can click the "Info" button at the top left to learn about the app and on the top right you have the option to click the music button to listen to some cool beats while you play. You simply slide the orange bar to play, as indicated, and go on to the question screen where you can ask the rowdyball anything and click the question mark in the middle of the blue triangle and that shows you over to the answer screen. We aim to make this an enjoyable experience for those short periods of times between classes or anything of the sort, afterall, we know how busy students are! To top it off, we ackowledge all the diversity UTSA houses and Rowdyball will not fall behind! You can choose from the 5 available languages from Rowdyball. Ready... set... Go!
